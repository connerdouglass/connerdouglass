# Conner Douglass

My name is Conner. I'm a systems engineer and full-stack web developer, mostly doing work in Go, TypeScript, and C. I've been building software for over 15 years.

I'm the co-founder and CTO of [Spire Technology](https://github.com/spiretechnology), where we build a video transcoding and streaming platform used by many of the biggest television shows.
